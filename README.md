### 一人で神に栄光を

I write JavaScript everywhere: front-end, back-end, and sometimes in the middle. I love over-architecting things in Meteor/Blaze. IntelliJ is my weapon of choice. CSS is wonderful - try to change my mind. Proficient troublemaker in React, Vue, Node, Webpack, Docker, Git, and CI/CD. Code responsibly and don't forget to refactor (you aren't prematurely optimizing, are you?).
